# Logo Maker

## Description

Welcome to Logo Maker! This CLI application creates a customized shape with text in a few short steps. When you type in node index in the terminal, you'll be asked a few quick questions: what text would you like on the shape, what color, and what shape would you like to generate. When you've answered the questions, an svg file will be generated at the root level. You can open this with default browser or live server to see your generated shape! You can also bring this svg out of the project and use it elsewhere!

## Installation

Ensure that you've download the inquirer dependency using the command "npm i inquirer@8.2.4". Also install jest. To launch the application, simply type in node index into the terminal, and you'll be prompted with the first question.

## Usage

To use the application, You simply type in node index, answer the questions, and when you're finished with the last question, the svg file will be generated.

## Contributing

For future contibutors of this application, It woud be useful to be able to customize the size, or pick a color from a color wheel when selecting color. Feel free to ask questions, request new features, improve documentation, use visual aids, or add new innovative technology to reduce the size of the application.

## Tests

In shapes.test.js, I tested for each shape to accept a color, and anticipated that the output would be the color set with the method setColor(). These tests passed for all shapes.

In svg.test.js, the setText() suite tested if an error would be thrown if the user typed in more than 3 characters, and if it would successfully create the shape in an instance where there was 3 characters or less. Both of these tests passed.

In the setShape() test suite, I tested if the setShape() function is passed a circle, if it would in fact generate a circle. This test passed.

In the render() test suite, I tested if the render function returned an svg with the given shapeData and textData. I also tested scenarios where no shapeData was entered but textData was, or vice versa, and all tests passed.
